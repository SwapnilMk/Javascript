learning javascript basic to advance :)


There are many resources available for learning JavaScript, both online and offline. Here are some suggestions for getting started with learning JavaScript:

The MDN JavaScript Guide is a great resource for learning the basics of JavaScript. It covers topics like variables, operators, loops, and functions.

Eloquent JavaScript is a popular online book that covers both the basics and advanced topics in JavaScript. It's a great resource for learning the language in depth.

Codecademy offers interactive tutorials for learning JavaScript, as well as many other programming languages. It's a great way to get hands-on experience with the language.

If you prefer offline learning, you might consider purchasing a book on JavaScript. There are many good books available for all skill levels, from beginner to advanced.

Once you have a basic understanding of JavaScript, it's a good idea to start working on some projects to apply your knowledge and gain experience. You can find project ideas and starter code on sites like GitHub, or you can come up with your own ideas.

I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
